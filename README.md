   3. [The backend of e-Book](e-Book_backend/) contains the backend codes.
   4. [The SQL scripts of e-Book] (plan to be updated soon!)


   ## Run
   You can use the following command to install the necessary dependencies for the frontend.

   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

   ## Usage

   For convenience, we recommend you to use IDEA for running both frontend and backend.
